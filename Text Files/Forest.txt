You shine your torch down each path. The middle path is a long winding road filled with glowing mushrooms. Down the path  to the right you see the teeth of a bear trap reflecting the torch light from under a pile of dirt and leaves. The left path is completely clear and you see an opening towards the end of the path. #3

You shine your torch down each path. The first path to the left is long and narrow, and as you move your torch you swear you see a pair of glinting eyes from the bushes. The second path in the middle is barely even a path with how overgrown it is, and it seems to lead a lot deeper into the forest. The third path to the right is completely clear and you see an opening towards the end of the path. #11

Accept your fate, its GAME OVER #0

You start down the middle path. You can barely see where you're stepping in the thick foliage as you trudge on for what seems like an eternity. Your steps slow as you begin to tire and you look at your surroundings. Nothing except forest and more forest. You look down and suddenly realise that there is no longer a path. At some point you must have lost it. You panic and try backtrack, but only seem to get deeper into the forest. You have no idea which way to go and have no choice but to keep blindly searching. It feels like you'll never find a way out...#14

"Wait I lied, I am completely lost (you tell him everything)." #18

"Wait I lied, I actually have been through hell. (you tell him everything)" #18

He stands silently as you summarise the recent events. "...Please help me."\nThe stranger steps towards you and places a hand on your shoulder. "I'm sorry", he says and briefly pauses. Maybe he's thinking of which way to get out of here! "Forgive me", he says. "Wha â€“?", you start, but he cuts you off. "You know too much. We cannot afford to let you go."... #18
