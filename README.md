# Point of Sale (POS) and Invoicing System for LG Packaging-- (PROTOTYPE)

This POS and invoicing system prototype was created as part of a group software development project for LG Packaging. The system was built using C# and SQL Server, focusing on streamlining inventory management, adjustment tracking, invoicing, and report generation for a small-scale packaging business.

## 👥 Team Members
This project was developed by a team of five students from UKZN:
- Sasthi Naidoo
- Migyle Naidoo
- Humairaa Iyoob
- Yusuf Abdul Roaf

## 🏢 About LG Packaging
LG Packaging is a well-established packaging business based in Durban, South Africa, with over 28 years of experience serving both business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-consumer (B2C) clients. The company specializes in manufacturing plastic bags and reselling complementary packaging products such as polystyrene cups, serviettes, plastic straws, and takeaway containers.

Despite its longevity and reputation, LG Packaging has historically relied on manual processes for core operations including inventory tracking, invoicing, and staff incentive management. These paper-based systems have led to inefficiencies, human error, and delays in decision-making.

Recognizing the need to modernize, We have developed a tailored Point of Sale and Invoicing System focused on automating:

📦 Inventory management

🧾 Invoicing workflows

💰 Incentive calculations (for Sales Staff)

📊 Business reporting

This system enables real-time stock updates, accurate and secure data handling, faster transaction processing, and smarter insights to support scalability and long-term growth.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- C# (.NET Framework)
- Windows Forms
- SQL Server Management Studio
- Draw.io (for UML ERD, DFD etc. diagrams)

## 💼 My Contributions
- Designed and implemented the **Inventory.cs Form** that allows staff to search through the product table in the database, search through product categories, update inventory records, and manage product statuses with built-in control features
- Coded **all report generation features**, enabling dynamic summaries and insights for decision-making  
- Created detailed **system diagrams** (UML ERD, DFD, Activity Diagrams etc.) to map out logic, data flow, and architecture 
- Produced supporting **documentation** used for planning, development, and final presentations  

## 🖼️ Project Highlights
- Modular design supporting adjustable product statuses (Available, Archived, Adjusted)  
- Functional database integration with real-time quantity updates  
- Report generation linked to stock levels and reorder thresholds  
- Interface tailored for staff usability and clarity
